        <p>
          i think, write, design, and code. i design, but i don’t mind what it
          is called. i do things—my things. i've got this dance playing out in
          my head - i'm both idealistic and pragmatic
        </p>
        <p>
          for me, it is all about design. everything is designed, whether
          design practices were used or not. so, for me, everything is either
          lousy design, good design, or remarkable design.
        </p>
        <p>
          but i'm also pragmatic, especially when thinking about problems. i'm
          drawn to complex systems, particularly design tools. i have an
          obsession with tools. tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then
          they shape us. there’s something meta in them that i’ve been drawn
          to since childhood. i'm drawn to things that create things: musical
          instruments, modular things, legos, systems, code, and design tools.
        </p>
        <p>i guess i’m hooked on creativity in a meta way.</p>
        <p>
          meta creativity - a desire to create and empower others to create.
          reflects a deep commitment to transforming and enriching the
          creative process by developing tools, systems, or frameworks that
          enhance or enable it.
        </p>
        <p>how it started</p>
        <p>
          when i met my wife, inbal, we immediately started working together.
          it felt completely natural, considering we were both designers at
          heart. i'm more technological, and inbal is more aestheticist, but i
          can say that we’re both drawn to beauty and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          soon enough, we became a design team—a one-stop shop for all things
          design—for a couple of years. we tackled everything: branding,
          product design, and some other crazy projects i don’t even want to
          talk about. before we knew it, we juggled a few projects with a
          multidisciplinary team worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          i can see a pattern in my career. i've always wanted to be a better
          designer. i thought learning programming, illustrating, marketing,
          and meditating—whatever, anything—would make me one.
        </p>
        <p>
          when i took my obsession with design tools one step further and
          created a new design-code tool, i got into the business side of
          things and learned the hard way how crucial it was for improving my
          design game. the more i learned about business and strategy, the
          more i realized we needed to focus on a niche. i started reading
          books and articles to figure out why we were doing things the way we
          were.
        </p>
        <p>also, we had red and negative numbers in our bank account.</p>
        <p>also, we were already parents to two girls.</p>
        <p>also, world pandemic.</p>
        <p>we realized we couldn't take it any longer.</p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          one day, my wife, inbal, said, "<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/" target="_blank"><span>i</span></a> saw this book
          you’re reading, something about “design… sprint?”,
          and i wondered, why aren't we doing the same thing for branding?”
          she continued… ”the best brand projects we’ve worked on went
          quickly, often within a week. i would get a great client, a great
          story, and collaborate. these projects were successful because i
          owned them. literally got shit done״.
        </p>
        <p>
          everything clicked for me. i felt that everything i believed in was
          finally coming together.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          that's how
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://weareunder.design/brand-sprint" target="_blank"><span>brand sprints</span></a>
          were born.
        </p>
        <p>
          this got us thinking we could develop a more defined process, create
          a productized service, and communicate it accordingly to the correct
          type of audience. so, we started doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          we ran our first three sprints for free. it was a new idea we were
          trying out, and when the pandemic hit, it was probably the right
          time to offer it for free!
        </p>
        <p>
          at first, we weren’t sure how to do it right, but kept doing it. we
          knew we had to stick with it, even though it was tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          it wasn’t easy. we received a lot of questions about such a
          controversial topic and even some different job offers, but we stuck
          to our plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          even though it didn’t make much sense then, we kept running sprints.
          we were about making quick and fancy visual identities and
          developing brand stories and strategies. we finally felt we were
          creating something of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          it clicked with some people and companies. they really liked the
          outputs, they got it, and it felt great. finally, we were doing
          meaningful stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          we started with 10 sprints, then 20, and gradually raised our
          prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          there was a time when we ran sprints one after another. it was
          exciting but really tough. each sprint felt like it took a lot out
          of us. but we kept optimizing.
        </p>
        <p>sprint. rest. repeat</p>
        <p>
          the sprint process is mentally intense and involves processing much
          information. it is not for everyone - designing is an intensive
          process that exercises our mental muscles. we make numerous
          decisions, including many micro-decisions that often go unspoken.
          this applies whether we are hands-on creators, creative directors,
          or simply work with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've experienced the strain from constant work, which is why i
          emphasize its importance. find the freedom to do your daily
          activities and work according to your rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          take extended breaks. it's not a marathon. rest and meditation
          between runs are not just beneficial but crucial.
        </p>
        <p>how it’s going</p>
        <p>
          we found a sweet spot that lets us make a profit and hire great
          people to ensure the success of our sprints. now, we can run about
          7-10 sprints a year, and that’s it. we’ve got our well-oiled brand
          sprint machine going.
        </p>
        <p>
          the brand sprints gave us the freedom and privilege to focus more on
          creating our own stuff.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          we’re dreaming (and doing) blending software and hardware
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://rnbw.company/" target="_blank"><span>creativity tools</span></a>
          for creators, and that's where i'm directing a lot of my and the
          company's energy nowadays, and i believe it has the potential to
          grow into something big.
        </p>
        <p>
          the thought of not running sprints in a few years is okay with me—i
          love what we do, and it's fulfilling. we enjoy the brand sprint
          process and would love to keep doing it, but on a larger scale and
          with an even more exciting type of company.
        </p>
        <p>
          even if we shift away from running sprints, we plan to share our
          knowledge or stay involved in branding somehow. like this evolving
          book and an ai assistant based on it to help others master our
          methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          (in the next chapter, we will briefly go through our process. then,
          we will scientifically break down each part in the following
          chapters. see you then)

      <h1>designing for gen z without feeling old</h1>
      <p>author:</p>
      <div>
        <p>wait, i recognize this</p>
        <p>
          during our research phase, we delved into tons of information about
          gen z, leading us to a fundamental realization. gen z looks up to
          the '90s in the same way that we, as someone who grew up in the
          '90s, looked up to the '60s! we admired the '60s for its primary,
          genuine, and somewhat naive essence. once we located ourselves
          within this admiration for the '90s, everything became clearer. it's
          about technology, but in a primary way - everything was at its
          inception, with a specific visualization and tone of voice.
        </p>
        <p>design choices and visual elements</p>
        <p>
          from vibrant color schemes to bold typography and seamlessly
          integrated visual elements, every aspect of our design was imbued
          with the essence of both nostalgia and modernity. it's this fusion
          that speaks to the heart of gen z, capturing their attention and
          empowering them to embrace their uniqueness. the color schemes,
          typography, and visual elements reflected this aesthetic, striking a
          balance between nostalgia and modernity. the color palette, while
          evoking a sense of nostalgia, remained empowering and inclusive,
          with shades of pink, orange, and red. bold typography served as a
          rebellion against conventional norms, embodying the spirit of
          protest and empowerment synonymous with gen z. illustrations and
          photography were seamlessly integrated, reminiscent of the 90´s
          magazines and wall collages. designing for gen z isn't just about
          aesthetics—it's about understanding, connection, and empowerment.
          it’s about authenticity.

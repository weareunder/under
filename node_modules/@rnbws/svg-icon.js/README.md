# svg-icon.js

Web component for SVG icons. Works in any web framework and for any purpose. Optimized for smooth design and development workflow (we built it for ourselves!).

## Install with Unpkg CDN

1. Add the following script to your page:
   ```
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/@rnbws/svg-icon.js/dist/svg-icon.min.js"></script>
   ```

## Install with NPM

1. On you Terminal
   ```
   npm i @rnbws/svg-icon.js
   ```
2. Use `/svg-icon.config.json` in your root directory and set the default `source`.

   You can use relative path based on the root directory

   ```html
   { "src": "icons/" }
   ```

   It can be also any other CDN

   ```html
   { "src": "https://raincons.rnbw.dev/" }
   ```

3. Enjoy icons/icons.html to view all your icons in a simple, organized, and searchable manner.
4. Place all of your icons in `/icons` at your root directory.
   ```
   root/
   â”œâ”€ icons/
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ icon1.svg
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ icon2.svg
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ icon3.svg/
   ```
   Youâ€™re ready to go!

## Usage

1. Set the `icon-name` within the elementâ€™s content.

   ```html
   <svg-icon>arrow</svg-icon>
   ```

   Or, you can do `folder/icon-name` if youâ€™ve categorized your library into folders.

   ```html
   <svg-icon>arrows/right</svg-icon>
   ```

   Override the source directly by setting a different one in the `src` attribute. You can Either use internal or external links.

   ```html
   <svg-icon src="https://rnbw.company/images/icon.svg"></svg-icon>
   ```

2. Colors are one of the main reasons `svg-icon.js` was created!

   The fill color of svg-icons is set by default to the inherited color of the font, so it can be overridden using a plain CSS selector.

   ```html
   <div style="color: red;">
     <svg-icon>arrow</svg-icon>
   </div>
   ```

   And, you can always override colors using the `color` attribute.

   ```html
   <svg-icon color="red">arrow</svg-icon>
   ```

3. You can set the `size` directly (or simply apply your own CSS).

   ```html
   <svg-icon size="80">arrow</svg-icon>
   ```

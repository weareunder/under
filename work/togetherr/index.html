      togetherr approached us to help them develop an identity for a platform
      that will match teams of marketing professionals to brand projects
      worldwide. In other words, it enables creative minds to own their
      creativity. togetherr is the new platform built by Fiverr and leaders in
      the creative industry with a mission to change how brands and creatives
      collaborate. togetherr’s brand speaks first and foremost to creatives,
      people whose enemies are system, complexity, lack of bravery,
      excitement, and time. That’s why their communication is bold and
      straightforward, with no BS. The design toolkit we chose for them is
      limited, but within it, we could go as crazy or as minimal as we need
      to. The identity is based on a black and white color palette and
      Helvetica Now, a new take on a classic font associated with the
      advertising world. We honored it by making it the heart of our visual
      language. The color comes in through the work of the creatives, giving
      them space and respect. We added patterns based on a square that ties
      them with the logo. <br />

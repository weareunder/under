      "Grab your jacket, your boots, your tent or your canoe - we’re off to discover new horizons. This is what the explorer archetype is all about, and what VisionCamp was created to be. Naturally independent, authentic, and curious, we follow unique paths and motivate others to explore the uncharted territory of their brands. We help those wanting to break free from the norm, who are not satisfied with standing still. We are the guides who will help leaders to reach new summits, push themselves, gain clarity over their direction and give them the tools and maps they need to get there. We’re a brave space for business leaders to draw up a chair around our bonfire, pour out a cup of cocoa and learn from us, the vision explorers and their fellow adventurers about how to grow their brands"

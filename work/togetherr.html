                <p>Togetherr</p>
                <p>Fiverr reached out to us to help them develop an identity for a new platform, Togetherr, that will match teams of marketing professionals to brand projects worldwide. In other words, it enables creative minds to own their creativity.

                    Togetherr’s brand speaks first and foremost to creatives, people whose enemies are system, complexity, lack of bravery, excitement, and time. That’s why their communication is bold and straightforward, with no BS. 
                    
                    The design toolkit we chose for them is limited, but within it, we could go as crazy or as minimal as we need to. The identity is based on a black and white color palette and Helvetica Now, a new take on a classic font associated with the advertising world. We honored it by making it the heart of our visual language. The color comes in through the work of the creatives, giving them space and respect. We added patterns that are based on a square that ties them with the logo.

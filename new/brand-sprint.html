                            During a high-profile brand project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Inbal and her team and run together a brand sprint. Inbal did astounding work, opened our minds to what we can do, and took the time and patience to understand what we need. Inbal's team collaborated perfectly with our internal designers and created the right infrastructure for us to move forward efficiently with our brand and build up our future brand assets. Working with Inbal I can say we didn't only successfully achieve our goal, but it was also fun tackling challenges together and getting there.                         <br />I am looking forward to our future collaboration.

The design was spot on - upgrading our current brand by an order of magnitude, all aligned to what we feel and how we think. We loved the productive mindset, out-of-the-sprint-box thinking, creativity with openness to feedback, and speedy iterations.

                                It was a true pleasure working with Inbal on our brand sprint. Besides the fact that Inbal got us right away, she was able to translate our vision into visuals and give our product and vision a visual identity. She's attentive, detail-oriented, incredibly patient, and persistent when needed. She ended up providing us with much more than we had asked for, simply because she believed in what we were doing and wanted to help us get a head start.

                                The brand sprint as a process is the right one for all startups, as there is a clear schedule and timeline which is the exact framework that we needed in order to move forward.

                                <br/>
                                I highly recommend Inbal and know that anyone will be lucky to have Inbal engaged in their brand definition and design.

                            <p>Inbal was the best partner I could choose to build Komodor‚Äôs brand with. She understands exactly what startups at this stage need and professionally leads this speedy process. She was able to overcome any obstacles we had along the way and was patient and resourceful in suggesting the right solution, all with a smile :) The result is a stunning brand and website, which makes Komodor stand out and expresses our values in the best way possible. I fully recommend working with Inbal! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p><span class="inactive">Merav Zaks | CMO, Komodor</span>

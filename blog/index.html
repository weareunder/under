        <p>what inspired you to become a designer?</p>
        <p> home was always an atmosphere of creativity: my grandpa was an
          architect, my uncles are musicians, and everyone knew how to draw or
          write beautifully. at home, my grandpa taught me about design
          programs and home planning. outside the house, i was always the one
          drawing and writing signs for youth movements, designing prints on
          shirts, and even tearing out notebook pages because the title didn‚Äôt
          come out right.over the years, i was always enchanted by my
          surroundings‚Äîi chose books by their covers, looked at signs, and
          thought about what could be done differently and better. in all the
          jobs i worked in before studying design, i always enjoyed the
          creative parts, no matter how small.one day, i saw the phrase ‚Äúfind
          a hobby you love and turn it into your job.‚Äù then i realized that in
          the world of design, i can express myself and work in a job that i
          enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>favorite shortcut?</p>
        <p>command+z, and I wish it worked in real life</p>
        <p>who are some of your top design inspirations?</p>
        <p> ‚Äòbuck‚Äô studio has been my great inspiration then and now. an amazing combination of many platforms -
          branding, animation, 2d, 3d,
          etc.everything they create is precise, unique, and visually
          stunning, utilizing a variety of techniques. they convey messages in
          their own distinctive way and evoke emotions in every animation
          video. a few years ago, i attended one of their lectures, and it was
          incredible to see the thought processes, planning, and construction
          behind each branding or video project they bring to life.
        </p>
        <p>where do you find inspiration outside of work?</p>
        <p> instagram, of course‚Äîalmost everything ends up there. books from my
          small home library. wherever i go, whether locally or abroad, i take
          pictures of beautiful and unique things i encounter, like coffee
          packaging, street posters, drink cans, interesting tiles and
          buildings, books, advertisements, and even concerts and
          conversations with people. anything that sparks thought and opens a
          door of inspiration. i can find inspiration in almost anything
          around me; i just need to look up.
        </p>
        <p>what‚Äôs your go-to background music or podcast while designing?</p>
        <p> i love listening to almost everything, especially to the radio, so i
          don‚Äôt have to bother with transferring songs, and that‚Äôs how i
          discover new good songs. but when i need to deeply think about
          branding processes, i listen to calmer songs, mainly from the
          60s-80s.and a tip for old-school music lovers and avengers fans- a
          surprisingly good playlist- ‚Äústarlord‚Äôs playlist‚Äù. thank me later.
        </p>
        <p>
          our favorite design trend at the moment?
        </p>
        <p> totally into 3d! any type, anywhere, realistic or amorphic! i‚Äôm addicted. in my eyes, it adds another
          dimension to every design,
          adds volume, and provides an opportunity to bring something new and
          different, playing with shapes/textures/lights. its possibilities
          are endless, and you can use it to reproduce everything you want and
          imagine.
        </p>
        <p> i love working with 3d. explore and learning about the many endless
          possibilities it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          what do you enjoy most about participating in brand sprints?
        </p>
        <p> first of all, from the general idea of ‚Äòbrand sprint,‚Äô it‚Äôs amazing
          how you can create quick and fancy branding within 10 days. what‚Äôs
          great is being able to one hundred percent in the process, without
          distractions and without thoughts about other processes.
        </p>
        <p> building branding captures the mind and the brain, and thinking
          about visual language engages me even after work hours. so it‚Äôs
          amazing to find references or think of more directions and bring
          them the next morning without losing momentum.
        </p>
        <p> what‚Äôs your favorite part about working with under?
        </p>
        <p> working in a team is the best part of the brand sprint! it‚Äôs enriching to see
          how other designers work live, what inspiration they bring, and how they think
          through and crack the brief. additionally, working in an open space (figma)
          allows us to adjust and add to each other‚Äôs designs, making them better and
          better, asking questions, and knowing that there are always several designers
          in the background to support and help. moreover, ‚Äòunder‚Äô creates an atmosphere
          of confidence and encourages you to bring every sketch and thought, make
          mistakes, and try any direction that comes to mind. this allows you to work
          freely, creatively, and intuitively, getting new ideas and proposing new
          solutions, which makes teamwork in general, and working under ‚Äòunder‚Äô in
          particular, so special and good.

      <h1>the brand sprint book - prologue</h1>
      <p>Thu 12 Jun</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          i think, write, design, and code. i design, but i don‚Äôt mind what it
          is called. i do things‚Äîmy things. i've got this dance playing out in
          my head - i'm both idealistic and pragmatic
        </p>
        <p>
          for me, it is all about design. everything is designed, whether
          design practices were used or not. so, for me, everything is either
          lousy design, good design, or remarkable design.
        </p>
        <p>
          but i'm also pragmatic, especially when thinking about problems. i'm
          drawn to complex systems, particularly design tools. i have an
          obsession with tools. tools are fascinating. we shape them, and then
          they shape us. there‚Äôs something meta in them that i‚Äôve been drawn
          to since childhood. i'm drawn to things that create things: musical
          instruments, modular things, legos, systems, code, and design tools.
        </p>
        <p>i guess i‚Äôm hooked on creativity in a meta way.</p>
        <p>
          meta creativity - a desire to create and empower others to create.
          reflects a deep commitment to transforming and enriching the
          creative process by developing tools, systems, or frameworks that
          enhance or enable it.
        </p>
        <p>how it started</p>
        <p>
          when i met my wife, inbal, we immediately started working together.
          it felt completely natural, considering we were both designers at
          heart. i'm more technological, and inbal is more aestheticist, but i
          can say that we‚Äôre both drawn to beauty and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          soon enough, we became a design team‚Äîa one-stop shop for all things
          design‚Äîfor a couple of years. we tackled everything: branding,
          product design, and some other crazy projects i don‚Äôt even want to
          talk about. before we knew it, we juggled a few projects with a
          multidisciplinary team worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          i can see a pattern in my career. i've always wanted to be a better
          designer. i thought learning programming, illustrating, marketing,
          and meditating‚Äîwhatever, anything‚Äîwould make me one.
        </p>
        <p>
          when i took my obsession with design tools one step further and
          created a new design-code tool, i got into the business side of
          things and learned the hard way how crucial it was for improving my
          design game. the more i learned about business and strategy, the
          more i realized we needed to focus on a niche. i started reading
          books and articles to figure out why we were doing things the way we
          were.
        </p>
        <p>also, we had red and negative numbers in our bank account.</p>
        <p>also, we were already parents to two girls.</p>
        <p>also, world pandemic.</p>
        <p>we realized we couldn't take it any longer.</p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          one day, my wife, inbal, said, "<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/"
            target="_blank"><span>i</span></a>
          saw this book you‚Äôre reading, something about ‚Äúdesign‚Ä¶ sprint?‚Äù, and
          i wondered, why aren't we doing the same thing for branding?‚Äù she
          continued‚Ä¶ ‚Äùthe best brand projects we‚Äôve worked on went quickly,
          often within a week. i would get a great client, a great story, and
          collaborate. these projects were successful because i owned them.
          literally got shit done◊¥.
        </p>
        <p>
          everything clicked for me. i felt that everything i believed in was
          finally coming together.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          that's how
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://weareunder.design/brand-sprint"
            target="_blank"><span>brand sprints</span></a>
          were born.
        </p>
        <p>
          this got us thinking we could develop a more defined process, create
          a productized service, and communicate it accordingly to the correct
          type of audience. so, we started doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          we ran our first three sprints for free. it was a new idea we were
          trying out, and when the pandemic hit, it was probably the right
          time to offer it for free!
        </p>
        <p>
          at first, we weren‚Äôt sure how to do it right, but kept doing it. we
          knew we had to stick with it, even though it was tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          it wasn‚Äôt easy. we received a lot of questions about such a
          controversial topic and even some different job offers, but we stuck
          to our plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          even though it didn‚Äôt make much sense then, we kept running sprints.
          we were about making quick and fancy visual identities and
          developing brand stories and strategies. we finally felt we were
          creating something of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          it clicked with some people and companies. they really liked the
          outputs, they got it, and it felt great. finally, we were doing
          meaningful stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          we started with 10 sprints, then 20, and gradually raised our
          prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          there was a time when we ran sprints one after another. it was
          exciting but really tough. each sprint felt like it took a lot out
          of us. but we kept optimizing.
        </p>
        <p>sprint. rest. repeat</p>
        <p>
          the sprint process is mentally intense and involves processing much
          information. it is not for everyone - designing is an intensive
          process that exercises our mental muscles. we make numerous
          decisions, including many micro-decisions that often go unspoken.
          this applies whether we are hands-on creators, creative directors,
          or simply work with people.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've experienced the strain from constant work, which is why i
          emphasize its importance. find the freedom to do your daily
          activities and work according to your rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          take extended breaks. it's not a marathon. rest and meditation
          between runs are not just beneficial but crucial.
        </p>
        <p>how it‚Äôs going</p>
        <p>
          we found a sweet spot that lets us make a profit and hire great
          people to ensure the success of our sprints. now, we can run about
          7-10 sprints a year, and that‚Äôs it. we‚Äôve got our well-oiled brand
          sprint machine going.
        </p>
        <p>
          the brand sprints gave us the freedom and privilege to focus more on
          creating our own stuff.
        </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block">
          we‚Äôre dreaming (and doing) blending software and hardware
          <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://rnbw.company/" target="_blank"><span>creativity
              tools</span></a>
          for creators, and that's where i'm directing a lot of my and the
          company's energy nowadays, and i believe it has the potential to
          grow into something big.
        </p>
        <p>
          the thought of not running sprints in a few years is okay with me‚Äîi
          love what we do, and it's fulfilling. we enjoy the brand sprint
          process and would love to keep doing it, but on a larger scale and
          with an even more exciting type of company.
        </p>
        <p>
          even if we shift away from running sprints, we plan to share our
          knowledge or stay involved in branding somehow. like this evolving
          book and an ai assistant based on it to help others master our
          methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          (in the next chapter, we will briefly go through our process. then,
          we will scientifically break down each part in the following
          chapters. see you then)

      <h1>designing for gen z without feeling old</h1>
      <p>Thu 13 Jun</p>
      <div>
        <p>wait, i recognize this</p>
        <p>
          during our research phase, we delved into tons of information about
          gen z, leading us to a fundamental realization. gen z looks up to
          the '90s in the same way that we, as someone who grew up in the
          '90s, looked up to the '60s! we admired the '60s for its primary,
          genuine, and somewhat naive essence. once we located ourselves
          within this admiration for the '90s, everything became clearer. it's
          about technology, but in a primary way - everything was at its
          inception, with a specific visualization and tone of voice.
        </p>
        <p>design choices and visual elements</p>
        <p>
          from vibrant color schemes to bold typography and seamlessly
          integrated visual elements, every aspect of our design was imbued
          with the essence of both nostalgia and modernity. it's this fusion
          that speaks to the heart of gen z, capturing their attention and
          empowering them to embrace their uniqueness. the color schemes,
          typography, and visual elements reflected this aesthetic, striking a
          balance between nostalgia and modernity. the color palette, while
          evoking a sense of nostalgia, remained empowering and inclusive,
          with shades of pink, orange, and red. bold typography served as a
          rebellion against conventional norms, embodying the spirit of
          protest and empowerment synonymous with gen z. illustrations and
          photography were seamlessly integrated, reminiscent of the 90¬¥s
          magazines and wall collages. designing for gen z isn't just about
          aesthetics‚Äîit's about understanding, connection, and empowerment.
          it‚Äôs about authenticity.

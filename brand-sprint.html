                            During a high-profile brand project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Inbal and her
                            team and run together a brand sprint. Inbal did astounding work, opened our minds to what we
                            can
                            do, and took the time and patience to understand what we need. Inbal's team collaborated
                            perfectly with our internal designers and created the right infrastructure for us to move
                            forward efficiently with our brand and build up our future brand assets. Working with Inbal
                            I
                            can say we didn't only successfully achieve our goal, but it was also fun tackling
                            challenges
                            together and getting there. <br>I am looking forward to our future collaboration.

                            the deliverables. The entire design process went smoothly, and we never felt rushed even
                            though the timeline was tight. Aside from all that, both Inbal and Anna are super
                            talented
                            designers and creative minds. We're thrilled with the final output.</p><p

                    <p>Thank you, Inbal and the team for a fantastic design project. It was a great pleasure to
                            work
                            with you on the branding of our company. You guys are sharp and on the point! The

                            was efficient, effective, and super enjoyable. You really turned it into a fun project,

                            really reinvent the design process, bringing in agile methodologies and I can now say -
                            this
                            is the only way to do it!</p><p class="inactive">Guy Salame | Co-founder,

                <div>
                    <p>Working with Inbal and the team (Ana & Luzia) was amazing. Not so common that the
                            professional level matches the interpersonal level, and in Inbal's case - they are both
                            at
                            the highest level. So besides the big fun of collaborating day in and day out for 2
                            weeks,
                            we loved the all-around professional attitude: Inbal helped us realize who we are, our
                            values, and our company personality. The design was spot on - upgrading our current
                            brand by
                            an order of magnitude, all aligned to what we feel and how we think. We loved the
                            productive
                            mindset, out-of-the-sprint-box thinking, creativity with openness to feedback, and
                            speedy
                            iterations. In conclusion - we highly recommend working with UNDER and look forward to
                            the
                            next projects :) Thank you!

                            The sprint was a great way for us to create our new branding with our tight schedule and

                            journey, she really understood us, where we wanted to take the brand and was highly
                            dedicated to the process and us. I highly recommend Under and the sprint process to any
                            startup that wants to create their brand fast but not compromises on the quality of

                    <p>I had the pleasure of working together. Normally, it's scary to give insurance companies
                            something so important, but I had no doubt that the results would be amazing and a boon
                            to
                            the company. What we imagine. The identity came out accurate and exciting and I am sure
                            it
                            will help us express our vision in the best way possible.

                    <p>Working with Inbal and her team was a thrilling experience with amazing results. You
                            would
                            never be able to tell that this high-quality brand work was done in a single 10-day
                            sprint.
                            For us as an early-stage start-up, this was a huge asset. Inbal was extremely attentive
                            to
                            our needs and led us in a collaborative effort to a beautiful end result that fit the
                            brief
                            and knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend working with Inbal and Under, and I
                            can‚Äôt
                            wait until we get to collaborate again.

                    <p>It was great fun working with you guys! You are soul players who understand the market
                            needs
                            - efficiency, creativity, and know-how to smile. I could not have done this branding
                            better
                            or faster without you. You are the heart of what Balance looks like, and I highly
                            recommend
                            anyone to drive Inbal crazy as I did; she will stand it :)

                    <p>It was a true pleasure working with Inbal on our brand sprint. Besides the fact that Inbal
                            got us right away, she was able to translate our vision into visuals and give our
                            product
                            and vision a visual identity. She's attentive, detail-oriented, incredibly patient, and
                            persistent when needed. She ended up providing us with much more than we had asked for,
                            simply because she believed in what we were doing and wanted to help us get a head
                            <br>
                            The brand sprint as a process is the right one for all startups, as there is a clear
                            schedule and timeline which is the exact framework that we needed in order to move
                            forward.
                            <br>
                            I highly recommend Inbal and know that anyone will be lucky to have Inbal engaged in
                            their
                            brand definition and design.

                            Inbal took our company story as input and helped us explore different directions in
                            quick
                            iterations. We got great value from Under's creative power, open-mindedness, and
                            hands-on
                            approach.

                        <p>Inbal was the best partner I could choose to build Komodor‚Äôs brand with. She understands
                            exactly what startups at this stage need and professionally leads this speedy process.
                            She
                            was able to overcome any obstacles we had along the way and was patient and resourceful
                            in
                            suggesting the right solution, all with a smile :) The result is a stunning brand and
                            website, which makes Komodor stand out and expresses our values in the best way
                            possible. I
                            fully recommend working with Inbal! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p><p class="inactive">Merav Zaks |

                            did
                            the brainstorm till the very end. Inbal and Ana helped us build a strong mature brand
                            that
                            will take us to the next level. Thanks a lot!

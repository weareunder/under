                        - “a hook is a musical idea, often a short riff,
                        passage, or phrase, used in popular music to make a song
                        appealing and to "catch the ear of the listener".
                        (Wikipedia). Visual design is music to our eyes, and
                        pretty much the same way, a hook is required to catch
                        the watcher’s attention. The best brand sprints are
                        where we identify this hook and create a visual that
                        focuses the entire brand identity around it.

                        No. Making one amazing idea is harder than creating many
                        different ones and picking one. This doesn't make it
                        easy for us, but it gives better results.

                        Our process follows a scientific approach. We begin with
                        a story and ensure a consistent message. Then, we set
                        anchors and use them to question everything daily. The
                        big stuff is discussed in our daily meetings, while the
                        remaining work, iterations, and feedback loops happen
                        through asynchronous communication.

                    <h5>
                        The process can be different for each company. It is
                        affected by the values and meaning that the logo should
                        represent. Whether the logo holds multiple meanings, and
                        which is the most powerful? Whether the logo is a symbol
                        or letters, why? The overall shape of the logo: literal
                        or abstract? Should the logo be just letters, and how
                        will it look in smaller formats? And more...

                    <h4>How do you choose colors?</h4>
                    <h5>
                        We respect colors. Early in the design process, we focus
                        on first getting the design to a stable place. We use as
                        few shades of black to emphasize function and meaning.
                        Once the design is "getting there," we all meet and make
                        a mindful choice. This way, we can see how the colors
                        are used throughout the design and ensure we can
                        empirically judge color palettes.

                        We build an oriented brand-sprint team for each sprint,
                        which includes ourselves - Inbal (art direction) and
                        Eden (strategy, design). There's a designer-illustrator
                        and sometimes an additional art director. In addition,
                        there are 2D/3D-Motion artists. We source talent
                        worldwide (mainly from Ukraine, India, Europe, and
                        more). We do not employ anyone directly, which gives us
                        much flexibility. Sometimes we decide we need something
                        particular, so we "go crazy" and make some fancy
                        production. We love working with entrepreneurs who only
                        have a little free time. who are ready to "give us the
                        keys.” Who are entirely "get" the brand sprint benefits
                        as formalized process and how it helps to get their
                        visual identity going in a quick and fancy way.

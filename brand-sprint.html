            have about “your brand” into something more concrete. We'll talk
            about your past, present, and future. We'll ask why's, how's and

          <h5>
            Let's find the "hook". It’s time to focus on concept development. We
            let ideas flow freely while exploring the meaning and essence of
            things. This will help us develop creative and inspiring concepts to
            set the stage for a successful project. Happy brainstorming!
          </h5>
          <p>
            a hook is a musical idea, often a short riff, passage, or phrase,
            used in popular music to make a song appealing and to "catch the ear
            of the listener". (Wikipedia). Visual design is music to our eyes,
            and pretty much the same way, a hook is required to catch the
            watcher’s attention. The best brand sprints are where we identify
            this hook and create a visual that focuses the entire brand identity
            around it.

            YES. We'll develop a clear vision, identify key values, and go from

          <h4>When is a good time to run a brand sprint for my company?</h4>
          <h5>
            Run a brand sprint when some brand process has happened already, and
            there's some consensus around it. Ensure it supports a business goal
            and fits your bigger picture perfectly.

        <div class="gap-m column">
          <h4>When is the right time to schedule a sprint?</h4>
          <h5>
            As early as you can - Like 2-3 months ahead. We're almost always
            booked with too much time on. That being said, S#!% happens, and it
            is worth reaching out anyway.

        </div>

        <div class="gap-m column">
          <h4>Who should participate?</h4>
          <h5>
            Your Brand Sprint team must include people with authority and
            ownership of your company's identity. The “champion” is the
            essential decision maker who says the “last word.” Champions know
            how to democratically bring everyone to the table, hear and collect
            all internal thoughts and transform them into actions in the
            decision-making junctions. In most cases, the Champion is the CEO,
            but in some cases, the decider could be another co-founder or CMO.

          <h4>What should we do before the sprint?</h4>

            Create as many things as possible to make the sprint run smoothly -
            Content is king, and everything is content. Your content is content.
            The UI screenshots are content. And the way all of your content is
            ordered is also content. We'd love to see the website's content as
            soon as possible - Your content should be ready before the sprint
            and before we write the brand story, as the brand story mainly
            functions as our brief. We're not expecting your content to be the
            final one, but it should be in high fidelity, knowing we'll develop
            and adjust it as we design. Also you should run an

        </div>

        <div class="gap-m column">
          <h4>Do you design more than one option?</h4>
          <h5>
            No. Making one amazing idea is harder than creating many different
            ones and picking one. This doesn't make it easy for us, but it gives
            the best results.

        </div>
        <div class="gap-m column">
          <h4>How are decisions made?</h4>
          <h5>
            Our process is scientific. We begin with a story and ensure a
            consistent message. Then, we set anchors and use them to question
            everything daily. The big stuff is discussed in our daily meetings,
            while the remaining work, iterations, and feedback loops happen
            through asynchronous communication.

          <h4>How do you design a logo?</h4>
          <h5>
            The process can be different for each company. It is affected by the
            values and meaning that the logo should represent. Whether the logo
            holds multiple meanings, and which is the most powerful? Whether the
            logo is a symbol or letters, why? The overall shape of the logo:
            literal or abstract? Should the logo be just letters, and how will
            it look in smaller formats? And more...

        </div>
        <div class="gap-m column">
          <h4>How do you choose colors?</h4>
          <h5>
            We respect colors. Early in the design process, we focus on first
            getting the design to a stable place. We use as few shades of black
            to emphasize function and meaning. Once the design is "getting
            there," we all meet and make a mindful choice. This way, we can see
            how the colors are used throughout the design and ensure we can
            empirically judge color palettes.

            The brand sprint team includes Inbal and Eden as Creative Directors
            and Kate as a Brand Designer. In addition, there are 2D/3D
            illustrators and motion artists. We source talent worldwide and do

            they're flexible—a must in the startup world. Their deep dive into
            our needs showed in the final design that everyone loved. Under
            blends attention to detail and agility, no trade-offs. Their skill
            in turning complex ideas into stunning visuals is next-level. The

            Inbal and Eden are branding superheroes (and a power couple!) who,
            in our case, have managed to master the art of creating a vibrant,
            playful and precise brand for us. Even though we were all a group of
            Millennials building a brand that went against everything we knew so
            far, using their almost-scientific methodology, they delivered
            results that are nothing short of mind-blowing and successfully
            resonated with our users. Their creativity knows no bounds, and they
            approached our project with unwavering attention and empathy. If you

            I worked with Eden and Ana from Under to develop a new brand for
            Collabria, our account management collaboration tool. What attracted
            us to them first was the no-holds-barred honesty and results-driven
            process. The entire sprint took about two weeks - we went in with
            nothing but a name, and came out with a coherent design ready to be
            used and implemented across every marketing channel. The team's
            superpower is their willingness to break every egg in sight to cook
            the world's greatest omlette. Don't hire them if you want somebody
            to chew up and spit your own ideas back at you. Hire them if you
            want your ideas challenged, broken down, and made better. You'll
            laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream, but in the end, you'll not only
            have an amazing brand, but you'll have a better understanding of who
            you are as a company and how your customers need to see you.

            I was chasing Inbal & Eden for a couple of months using every trick
            in the book, and it paid off big time. I knew that when I got to
            Raftt, there was NOTHING. No brand, no website, no story, no logo
            (except the one the Co-Founder designed..). I needed a team of pros
            with an exceptional eye for design to elevate us to the vision we
            imagined. We've worked with Eden and Kate and enjoyed the ten-day
            brand sprint and their professional approach. We were lucky to have
            them as part of our building blocks. Needless to say that
            the outcome is flawless, unique, and exceptional. If you're
            considering working with Under- I'll be happy to hop on a call and
            explain our process and overall experience.

            field with innovative concepts is remarkable, and together with the
            team, she delivered an outstanding brand identity and surpassed our
            already-high expectations of her :) Thank you, Inbal, Eden, and

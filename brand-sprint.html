                Champions know how to democratically bring everyone to the table, hear and collect all internal thoughts
                and transform them into actions in the decision-making junctions.

                sprint and before we write the brand story, as the brand story mainly functions as our brief.

                We're not expecting your content to be the final one, but it should be in high fidelity and ready for
                the design to some extent, knowing we're going to develop and adjust it as we design.</p>

                addition, there are 2D/3D-Motion artists.

                We source talent worldwide (mainly from Ukraine, India, Europe, and more). We do not employ anyone
                directly, which gives us much flexibility. Sometimes we "go crazy" and decide that we need something
                particular and look for someone who knows how to do it or make some fancy production ourselves.</p>
